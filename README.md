# Average-Coffee-Consumption
This projects is a DSA210 term project whichâ€™s aim is to check that the average coffee consumption amount under some conditions and its relation with other factors.

# Data Set
My data set for this project is my Credit Card Statement and banck account activities which are collected from Bank's official application. 

Also, since I am planning to compare and contrast the amount of coffee I bought with the daily step I walked, I am also planning to get data from Apple's Health app.

In addition to those, I wonder whether I consume more coffee during the exam periods or not. To examine that I am planning to get data from Calendar app.

# Project Idea
The idea of this project is to find a relation between the amount of coffe I consume and my daily step. In addition to that, I also want to find the relation between the amount of coffe I consume and my exam period.

# Project Plan
First, I will collect data from the Bank's App, Apple Health app and Calendar. Next, with the EDA methods that we learned, I will categorize the data which are taken from the Bank's app, so that the data set that I have bacomes meaningfull. Later, I will compare the amount of money that I spent to coffee with my daily step and try to find a relation. Also, I am going to do the previous step for exam period. While comparing, I am going to divide dates in categories such as weekday, exam day, weekend etc. so that the comparisons become more meaningful and also this could give us another correlation. Finally, with the findings that I will have, I am going to reject or fail to reject my null Hypothesis which is "There is a correlation between coffee asumption and daily step" and my other hypothesis "There is a correlation between coffee asumption and exam period". Lastly, with the usage of Machine Learning Models, I am going to predict my coffee asumption or the amount of money that I spent to coffee for next 3 or 6 months.
